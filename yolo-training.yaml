# Image augmentation
hsv_h: 0.015      # Image HSV-Hue augmentation (fraction) - Adjusts color hue

degrees: 10.0     # Image rotation (+/- deg) - Rotates images slightly
translate: 0.1    # Image translation (+/- fraction) - Shifts images horizontally/vertically
scale: 0.2        # Image scale (+/- gain) - Zooms images in/out
shear: 2.0        # Image shear (+/- deg) - Tilts images
perspective: 0.0  # Image perspective (+/- fraction) range 0-0.001 - Applies perspective distortion (often kept low or 0)
